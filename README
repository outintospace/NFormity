NFormity

NFormity is a reimagining of the ASP.NET MVC 3 view generators. It just pretties up the layout a bit. When I build Ruby on Rails apps, I like to use Justin French's awesome Formtastic gem. When I build ASP.NET MVC apps, I'm always futzing with the T4 templates to make them work the way I want them to.

So, I decided to create NFormity, which is simply a collection of T4 templates used for generating views in ASP.NET MVC 3.

What does the future hold? Perhaps NHaml templates, maybe some actual form element manipulation like Formtastic.

How to Use the Templates

In the root of your ASP.NET MVC project, create a folder called CodeTemplates. Put the contents of the NFormity project in there.
